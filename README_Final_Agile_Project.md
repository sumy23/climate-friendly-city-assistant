#  Climate-Friendly City Assistant – Agile Final Project

This project presents a system proposal to address the increasing effects of climate change in Istanbul. Developed using Agile methodology, it includes IoT infrastructure, cloud architecture, machine learning analytics, and mobile/web applications.

##  Project Objective

To create a scalable smart assistant that:
- Collects real-time environmental data (temperature, air quality, rainfall)
- Analyzes patterns using machine learning
- Notifies users and municipalities of environmental risks
- Offers personalized sustainability tips to citizens

##  System Architecture

The proposed system consists of three main layers:

### 1️ Data Collection & Processing Layer
- **IoT Sensors:** Measure temperature, humidity, PM2.5, CO2, noise, wind
- **Protocols:** MQTT / HTTP
- **Databases:** MongoDB (NoSQL), InfluxDB (time-series)
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure

### 2️ Analytics & Prediction Layer
- **ML Models:** Python or R for forecasting pollution and weather trends
- **Big Data Tools:** Apache Spark or Hadoop
- **API Framework:** Flask or FastAPI

### 3️ User Interaction Layer
- **Mobile App:** Flutter or React Native
- **Web Platform:** Vue.js or React (frontend), Node.js (backend)
- **Visuals:** D3.js / Chart.js for real-time graphs

##  Agile Development Process

- Storyboard and mockups created (CANVA + hand-drawn)
- Functional decomposition and system modeling (draw.io)
- UML diagrams:
  - Class Diagram
  - Use Case Diagram
  - Sequence Diagram
  - State Diagram
- Features mapped using the **Kano Model**
- Sprints planned around:
  - IoT integration
  - Backend data processing
  - App development
  - Testing and deployment

## Security & Privacy

- **Encryption:** TLS/SSL for data transmission
- **Compliance:** GDPR and KVKK standards
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 or JWT
- **Backup:** Cloud-based daily recovery systems

## Continuous Delivery

- CI/CD pipelines: Jenkins, GitLab CI
- Version control: GitHub or GitLab
- Ongoing updates based on user feedback
